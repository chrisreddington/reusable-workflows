# This workflow validates the Dev Container configuration and required files in a repository
#
# Inputs:
#   required-extensions:
#     Description: Comma-separated list of required VS Code extensions
#     Required: false
#     Default: GitHub.codespaces and other essential GitHub extensions
#
#   required-features:
#     Description: Comma-separated list of required Dev Container features
#     Required: false
#     Default: ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/github-cli,ghcr.io/devcontainers-extra/features/act
#
#   devcontainer-path:
#     Description: Path to devcontainer.json file
#     Required: false
#     Default: .devcontainer/devcontainer.json
